# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning models based on various physicochemical properties. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## üìå Project Overview

Wine quality is a key factor in the wine industry. Using chemical attributes, this project builds a classifier to predict whether a wine sample is of good or bad quality. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset of red/white wine samples.
